# Time Complexity
### Rate at which the time taken increases W.R.T input size expressed in Big 0 Notation

TC != Time taken
avoid constant and Lower Values

## Order of Growth
Way of predicting how execution time of a program and the space / memory occupied by it chnage with input size , it gives worst case possibility for an algo

## Asympotic Notation
Used to describe the time or space complexity of an algo in term of input size(n) , especially for large input 

Type -> Big 0 [Upper boud / Worst Case] , Big omega [Lower Bound / Best Case], Thete [Average Case]

### Rules For Calculating TC
1. Ignore Constant and Lower terms
2. Sequential Statemnets add up.
3. Nested Loops Multiply 
     O(n*n) = O(N^2)
4. Drop Constant 
5. Logorithmic Behavior -> Every Time you halves the problem ->O(log n)

Loop Inside a loop -> Multiply
Loop After the Loop -> Add

1. Log base doesn't Matter | Extremely efficient for large N
