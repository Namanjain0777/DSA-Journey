# Space Complexity
Amount of memeory an algo uses to solve a problem

SC = Input Size + Auxiliary Space (Space that you use to solve the problem)

# Focus on Auxilary space in interview

Efficient Algo use less space and reduce cache misses

1. Time and space are often Trade off
2. Helps avoid out of memory or stack overflow in recursion
3. Every recursion call adds space
4. Local Variable -> o(1)
5. Array / List -> Depends on Length
6. For Recursion 
    Space = Stack Depth * memory per frame
7. Count Only extra space , not Input
8. Loops reuse same variable -> Still O(1)
9. Recursion Depth Directly Affect Space
10. Recursion Algo ->  Always use stack space
11. We can optimize space by using Variable Instead of arrays


## Measuring Space Complexity
1. Identify all Variable (Constant -> O(1))
2. Add Array / Object Size (Depents on N)
3. Incluse Recursive Calls
4. Drop Constant and Lower Terms

## Ways To reduce Memory Usage
1. Use variable intead of Arrays
2. Use iterative approach inteads of Recursion
3. Re use Array or modify input  in place
4. choose efficient data structure

## Optimization Goal -> Achieve min Time And Space Complexity

## More memory Offen = Faster Execution(Trade off)
