# 🧠 Heaps (Priority Queue) – Complete Practice Roadmap (Java / DSA)

## How to Practice (Recommended)
- Do **4–6 questions/day**
- Write **code + 1–2 line explanation**
- Always mention **Time & Space Complexity**
- Implement using:
  - Java `PriorityQueue`
  - AND **manual heap (array-based)** for interviews

26. Find median of a stream.
27. Connect N ropes with minimum cost.
28. Find K closest elements to X.
29. Find K closest points to origin.

## 🟡 MEDIUM LEVEL (Implementation)

## Manual Heap (Array-based)
31. Implement Min Heap from scratch.
32. Implement Max Heap from scratch.
33. Insert element in heap.
34. Delete element from heap.
35. Heapify up.
36. Heapify down.
37. Build heap from array.
38. Heapsort algorithm.

## 🔴 INTERVIEW LEVEL (🔥 MUST-DO)

## Advanced Heap Problems
39. Sliding Window Median.
40. Reorganize string using heap.
41. Task Scheduler problem.
42. Frequency sort using heap.
43. Find Kth largest element in a stream.
44. IPO problem (maximize capital).
45. Smallest range covering elements from K lists.
46. Top K frequent words.
47. K closest numbers in sorted array.
48. Minimum cost to hire K workers.

## ⭐ BONUS (Top Interview Favorites)

## Conceptual Questions
49. Why heap is not suitable for searching arbitrary elements?
50. Difference between heap and BST.
51. Why heap is implemented as array?
52. Why PriorityQueue in Java is Min Heap by default?
53. Why heap sort is not stable?
54. Why heap is a complete binary tree?
55. When to use heap over sorting?
56. Space complexity of heap.

---

## 🧠 Pattern Recognition (VERY IMPORTANT)

- **Top / K-th problems** → Heap
- **Streaming data** → Heap
- **Repeated min/max extraction** → Heap
- **Merge sorted data** → Heap
- **Median finding** → Two heaps (max + min)
- **Frequency-based problems** → Heap + HashMap

---

## 🧪 Practice Strategy (BEST WAY)

1. Always draw heap as a tree
2. Write index relationships:
   - Parent = (i - 1) / 2
   - Left child = 2i + 1
   - Right child = 2i + 2
3. Practice both min & max heap
4. Analyze time complexity

## 🎯 Final Goal

By the end of this list, you should be able to:
- Solve heap-based interview problems
- Implement heap from scratch
- Choose heap vs sorting vs binary search correctly
