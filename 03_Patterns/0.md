# Patterns 
1. No of line = No of rows = No of times outer loop will run
2. Identify for every row no
    a. How many columns are there
    b. Types of elements in columns
3. What do you need to Print


## Tips
1. Use nested Loops ( Outer Loops ->  Rows | Inner Loops -> Columns)
2. Spcae and Character Are equally Imp
3. Understant Pattern Symmetry
4. Think line By Line
5. Practice Virualization Before writing Code

### Before Solving Ask:
1. How many rows (Outer Loop Range)
2. What changes in each rows?
3. Symmerty?
4. Is it solid or hollow ? (Full fill or boundry only)
5. What's Printed?

Find Mathematical Reletion Between Rows and Columns

6. Always print spcae first then patterns
7. Test for small input first
8. Practice dry run manually


### What  to do when you see patterns
1. Count Rows
2. Count Spaces
3. Count Stars
4. Combine - Print space ->Stars ->PrintLn()

### If there is Symmetric 
#### i < 2N -1
