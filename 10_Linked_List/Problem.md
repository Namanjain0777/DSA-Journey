# 🧠 LinkedList – Complete Practice Roadmap (Java / DSA)

## 🟢 EASY LEVEL (Warm-up) — LinkedList Basics

### Java LinkedList (Built-in)

1. Create a `LinkedList` and add elements.
2. Add element at:
   - beginning
   - end
   - specific index
3. Remove element from:
   - beginning
   - end
   - specific index
4. Get first and last element.
5. Check if LinkedList is empty.
6. Find size of LinkedList.
7. Iterate through LinkedList using:
   - for loop
   - for-each loop
   - Iterator
8. Convert LinkedList to Array.
9. Convert Array to LinkedList.
10. Clear all elements from LinkedList.

### Custom Singly LinkedList (VERY IMPORTANT)   Haventy Done This

11. Create a `Node` class.
12. Insert at head.
13. Insert at tail.
14. Print LinkedList.
15. Count number of nodes.
16. Search an element in LinkedList.

## 🟡 MEDIUM LEVEL (Logic + Pointer Thinking)

### Singly LinkedList

17. Delete a node by value.
18. Delete a node by position.
19. Find middle element of LinkedList.
20. Reverse a LinkedList (iterative).
21. Reverse a LinkedList (recursive).
22. Detect loop in LinkedList.
23. Find length of loop.
24. Remove loop from LinkedList.
25. Find Nth node from end.
26. Find intersection point of two LinkedLists.
27. Check if LinkedList is palindrome.
28. Pairwise swap nodes.
29. Sort a LinkedList.
30. Remove duplicates from:
    - sorted LinkedList
    - unsorted LinkedList

---

### Doubly LinkedList

31. Create a Doubly LinkedList.
32. Insert at beginning and end.
33. Delete a node in Doubly LinkedList.
34. Reverse a Doubly LinkedList.

---

## 🔴 INTERVIEW LEVEL (🔥 MUST-DO)

### Concept + Coding Mix

35. Difference between:
    - Array vs LinkedList
36. Why LinkedList insertion is faster than Array?
37. Why random access is slow in LinkedList?
38. When should you use LinkedList over ArrayList?
39. Why LinkedList uses more memory than ArrayList?
40. Implement LinkedList without using Java library.

---

### Advanced LinkedList Problems (VERY COMMON)

41. Merge two sorted LinkedLists.
42. Add two numbers represented by LinkedList.
43. Rotate LinkedList by K places.
44. Flatten a LinkedList.
45. Clone a LinkedList with random pointer.
46. Segregate even and odd nodes.
47. Reverse nodes in groups of K.
48. Check if two LinkedLists are identical.
49. Delete nodes having greater value on right.
50. Reorder List (L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1).

---

## ⭐ BONUS (Top Interview Favorites)

51. Why LinkedList is not thread-safe?
52. Can we do binary search on LinkedList? Why / why not?
53. Time complexity of:
    - insert at head
    - insert at tail
    - delete node
    - search
54. Difference between:
    - Singly LinkedList vs Doubly LinkedList
55. Real-life use cases of LinkedList.
56. Implement Stack using LinkedList.
57. Implement Queue using LinkedList.

---

## 🧠 Pattern Recognition (VERY IMPORTANT)

- **Two pointers** → Slow / Fast pointer
- **Nth from end** → Two pointers
- **Cycle detection** → Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm
- **Reverse LinkedList** → Pointer manipulation
- **Palindrome LinkedList** → Find middle + reverse second half

---

## 🎯 Goal

By completing this roadmap, you should be able to:
- Implement LinkedList from scratch
- Solve interview-level LinkedList problems
- Identify patterns instantly in DSA questions
